# Summary

The Anthropocene is marked by increased population extirpations and redistributions driven primarily by human-induced climate change and habitat loss. Habitat loss can be structured across space (e.g., fragmentation) and environmentally (e.g., land cover conversion for agriculture primarily in the valleys of a mountain-valley landscape). The consequences of spatially and environmentally structured habitat loss on the adaptive potential of populations facing a changing environment (e.g., through climate change) is not well understood. Here, we develop spatially-explicit, individual-based models with a genetics component to understand the consequences of biases in habitat loss on the ability for locally adapted populations to respond to a changing environment.
